GREEDY ROBOT 
created: Fall Quater @ University of Washington Bothell 

Project Description:
A robot is positioned on an integral point in a two-dimensional coordinate grid (x1, y1).  
There is a treasure that has been placed at a point in the same grid at (x2, y2).  x1, x2, y1, and y2 are all integers.  
The robot can move up (North), down (South), left (West), or right (East).
Commands can be given to the robot to move one position in one of the four direction. 
That is, “E” moves a robot one slot East (to the right) so if the robot was on position (3, 4), it would now be on (4, 4).
The command N would move the robot one position north so a robot at position (4, 4) would be at (4, 5).
Write a recursive program which determines all the unique shortest paths from the robot to the treasure.   
The input to the program will be the position of the robot (x1, y1) and the position of the treasure (x2, y2):  four integers.  
For instance, an input of 1 3 -2 4 corresponds to the robot starting at position (1, 3) and needing to get to position (-2, 4).  
Do not worry about error conditions on input as we will assume the input is well formed.  Read the input from the console.
